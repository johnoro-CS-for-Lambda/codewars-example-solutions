# Explanation:
This solution uses the [filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) and [includes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/includes) methods.

The `filter` method will return a new array with all of the elements that meet a requirement.

The `includes` method will return `true` or `false` based on whether an array includes a value.

Here's it all together:
```javascript
// Filter from array a any values that are included in array b, and return that filtered array.
```
