# Explanation:
This solution uses the [`replace`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace) method. This can take a [regular expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions)(A.K.A. a regexp) as the first argument, and also take a function, which will be applied to all matches, as the second argument. 

For the regexp, we simply match anything that's 'a' or 'b'. We make sure it matches everything that fits that criteria with the global flag, `g`. The callback isn't too hard to follow, but the [ternary](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator) is just a shorthand for an `if else`.
