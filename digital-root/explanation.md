# Explanation:
The idea here is to keep reducing our number by summing its digits, summing that sum's digits, and so on until it's a single digit.

Here are some syntax links for stuff that _could_ be offputting:
* [Spread syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax)
* [reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce)
* [Ternary operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator)
