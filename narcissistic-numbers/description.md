# Description:
A Narcissistic Number is a number of length x in which the sum of its digits to the power of x is equal to the original number. If this seems confusing, refer to the example below.

_Ex: 153, where x = 3 (number of digits in 153)_

_1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153_

Write a method `isNarcissistic(n)` which returns whether or not `n` is a narcissistic number.
